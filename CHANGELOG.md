# Changelog

## [0.21.0] - 2025-11-23

### Added
- **Multi-Provider AI Support**: Added support for Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), and Google (Gemini) for book recommendations.
- **AI Settings UI**: New "AI Integration" tab in Settings page to configure provider, API key, model, and base URL.
- **AI Service Abstraction**: Created `src/services/aiService.js` to handle multiple AI providers with a unified interface.
- **Settings Persistence**: AI configuration is now saved in the application settings (JSON/KV) rather than relying solely on environment variables.

### Changed
- **Recommendation Logic**: Updated backend (`server/index.js` and `src/routes/books.js`) to use the configured AI provider from settings.
- **Environment Variables**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is now optional and serves as a backward-compatible fallback if no provider is configured in the UI.
- **Documentation**: Updated `AGENTS.md` and `app_overview.md` to reflect the new AI configuration options.
