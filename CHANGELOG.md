# Changelog

## [0.23.0] - 2025-11-23

### Changed
- **Security**: Removed hardcoded `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from `wrangler.toml` and backend code.
- **Configuration**: Enforced API key configuration via the Settings page for all AI providers.
- **Error Handling**: Improved fallback mechanism to gracefully handle missing API keys without triggering 401 errors.

## [0.22.0] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed
- **AI Key Persistence**: Fixed issue where API keys were not persisting correctly per provider. Keys are now stored in a `keys` object within settings.
- **Settings Update**: Fixed "t is not a function" error by implementing `updateSettings` in `AppContext`.
- **Worker Route**: Updated `src/routes/books.js` to correctly resolve API keys from settings in the Cloudflare Worker environment.

## [0.21.0] - 2025-11-23

### Added
- **Multi-Provider AI Support**: Added support for Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), and Google (Gemini) for book recommendations.
- **AI Settings UI**: New "AI Integration" tab in Settings page to configure provider, API key, model, and base URL.
- **AI Service Abstraction**: Created `src/services/aiService.js` to handle multiple AI providers with a unified interface.
- **Settings Persistence**: AI configuration is now saved in the application settings (JSON/KV) rather than relying solely on environment variables.

### Changed
- **Recommendation Logic**: Updated backend (`server/index.js` and `src/routes/books.js`) to use the configured AI provider from settings.
- **Environment Variables**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is now optional and serves as a backward-compatible fallback if no provider is configured in the UI.
- **Documentation**: Updated `AGENTS.md` and `app_overview.md` to reflect the new AI configuration options.

## [0.20.1] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed

- **Environment Detection**: Improved detection of Cloudflare Worker environment to prevent "KV namespace not bound" errors.
- **Build Process**: Updated build scripts to ensure proper environment variable handling during deployment.

### Added

- **Dual Architecture**: Application now supports both local Express/JSON and Cloudflare/KV architectures.

### Changed
- **Data Layer Abstraction**: Refactored data access into a provider pattern (`src/data/index.js`) to switch between JSON and KV storage.
- **API Routes**: Migrated API routes to support both Express and Hono adapters.
- **UUID Generation**: Switched to `crypto.getRandomValues` for compatibility with Edge environments.
