## 1.15.2 - 2025-09-14

### Fixed
- **Book Recommendations Data Provider Issue**: Fixed critical issue where book recommendations weren't working in KV storage mode due to incorrect data access pattern
  - **Data Provider Consistency**: Updated recommendations endpoint to use proper data provider pattern instead of direct KV service calls ([`src/routes/books.js`](src/routes/books.js:210))
  - **Storage Pattern Alignment**: Books are stored in separate KV key `'books'` via kvProvider, but recommendations was incorrectly using kvService which looks in main `app_data` structure
  - **Production Fix**: Resolves "Retrieved books: 0 total books" error in Cloudflare Workers production environment
  - **Architecture Compliance**: Ensures all book operations follow the established `createProvider(env)` pattern for dual architecture support

### Technical Implementation
- **Provider Pattern Enforcement**: Changed from `getBooks(c.env)` to `provider.getAllBooks()` for consistent data access
- **KV Storage Optimization**: Leverages existing separate `'books'` KV key structure for efficient book retrieval
- **Dual Architecture Support**: Maintains compatibility between JSON file storage (local) and KV storage (production)

## 1.15.1 - 2025-09-14

### Fixed

  - **KV Compatibility**: Reading sessions now properly display books read regardless of whether `bookId` field was omitted during JSON serialization
  - **Dual Architecture Support**: Maintains consistent behavior between JSON and KV storage modes for book recommendations and reading history display
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Ensures existing KV data with missing fields is automatically normalized without requiring data migration

### Technical Implementation
- **Field Normalization**: Added automatic field population for reading sessions missing `bookId` property
