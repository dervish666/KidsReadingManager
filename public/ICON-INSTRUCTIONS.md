# Icon and Favicon Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to set up the favicon and icons for the Kids Reading Manager application.

## Quick Setup

1. Open the `favicon-generator.html` file in your browser
2. Right-click on the book icon and save it as `favicon.ico` in the `public` directory
3. Open the `png-icon-generator.html` file in your browser
4. Right-click on the canvas and save it as `logo192.png` in the `public` directory

## Files Included

- `book-icon.svg` - SVG version of the book icon (already set up)
- `favicon-generator.html` - Helper to generate the favicon.ico file
- `png-icon-generator.html` - Helper to generate the logo192.png file

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to use your own icon or a different book icon, you can:

1. Create your own favicon.ico file (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 pixels)
2. Create your own logo192.png file (192x192 pixels)
3. Replace the book-icon.svg file with your own SVG icon

## Verification

After setting up the icons and rebuilding the application:

1. The browser tab should show the book icon as the favicon
2. The title should be "Kids Reading Manager" instead of "React App"

## Troubleshooting

If the favicon or title doesn't update:

1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Make sure the favicon.ico file is in the public directory
3. Rebuild the application with `npm run build`
4. Restart the development server with `npm start`
