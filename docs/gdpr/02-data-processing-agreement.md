## Schedule 1 -- Technical and Organisational Security Measures

This Schedule describes the technical and organisational security measures implemented by the Processor in accordance with Article 32 of the UK GDPR. For the avoidance of doubt, the measures listed below represent the minimum standard to be maintained, and the Processor may implement additional measures from time to time.

### 1. Authentication and Access Control

| Measure | Description |
|---|---|
| Password hashing | PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations using cryptographically secure random salts. Plain-text passwords are never stored or logged. |
| Encryption of secrets | API keys and other secrets are encrypted at rest using AES-GCM. |
| Role-based access control | Four-tier role hierarchy (Owner, Admin, Teacher, Readonly) with permission enforcement at the application layer. Each role is restricted to a defined set of operations. |
| Token-based authentication | JWT access tokens (15-minute expiry) with refresh tokens (7-day expiry). Tokens are automatically rotated prior to expiry. |
| Rate limiting | Authentication endpoints are subject to rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks, with attempt counts stored per-user. |

### 2. Data Isolation and Multi-Tenancy

| Measure | Description |
|---|---|
| Organisation-scoped queries | All database queries are scoped to the authenticated organisation, enforced by middleware. No cross-tenant data access is possible through the application layer. |
| Tenant middleware | A dedicated middleware layer injects and enforces organisation context on every authenticated request. |
| Soft delete | Deactivated organisations and user accounts are soft-deleted (marked inactive) rather than hard-deleted, preventing accidental data loss while allowing recovery. |

### 3. Transport Security

| Measure | Description |
|---|---|
| TLS encryption | All data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher, enforced by the infrastructure provider (Cloudflare). |
| HSTS | HTTP Strict Transport Security headers are applied to all responses, preventing protocol downgrade attacks. |
| Security headers | Additional security headers are applied, including Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Referrer-Policy. |

### 4. Infrastructure Security

| Measure | Description |
|---|---|
| Edge hosting | The platform is hosted on Cloudflare's global edge network, benefiting from Cloudflare's enterprise-grade DDoS protection, Web Application Firewall, and network security. |
| Serverless architecture | The application runs on Cloudflare Workers (serverless), eliminating the need to manage or patch servers and reducing the attack surface. |
| Database encryption | Data at rest in Cloudflare D1 is encrypted using Cloudflare's encryption at rest capabilities. |

### 5. Application Security

| Measure | Description |
|---|---|
| Input validation | All user inputs are validated and sanitised before processing. |
| Error handling | A global error handler sanitises all 5xx error responses to prevent leakage of internal system details. |
| Audit logging | Administrative actions are logged for audit trail purposes, including the user, action, and timestamp. |
| CORS policy | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is restricted to explicitly whitelisted domains. |

### 6. Data Minimisation

| Measure | Description |
|---|---|
| AI recommendations | When generating book recommendations, only non-identifying data is sent to AI providers (reading level, genre preferences, and reading history summary). Student names and other directly identifying information are not transmitted. |
| No special category data | The platform is not designed to collect or process special category data. Free-text fields are provided for teacher observations but are not intended for recording sensitive personal characteristics. |

### 7. Organisational Measures

| Measure | Description |
|---|---|
| Confidentiality obligations | All personnel with access to Personal Data are subject to confidentiality obligations. |
| Access on need-to-know basis | Access to production systems and data is limited to authorised personnel who require it for the performance of their duties. |
| Incident response | The Processor maintains an incident response procedure for identifying, containing, and reporting Personal Data Breaches. |
| Regular review | Security measures are reviewed and updated on a regular basis to reflect changes in technology, threats, and Applicable Data Protection Law. |

---
