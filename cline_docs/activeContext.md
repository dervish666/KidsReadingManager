# Active Context: Kids Reading Manager

## What I'm Working On Now
I'm implementing a feature to view, edit, and delete student reading sessions. This feature will allow users to:
1. View all reading sessions for a specific student by clicking on their card
2. Edit session details (date, assessment level, notes)
3. Delete sessions that are no longer needed

This enhancement will give users more control over the reading session data and make it easier to manage student records.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented application settings functionality
  - Created a new Settings component to manage application settings
  - Added ability to configure reading status durations (days for "Recently Read" and "Needs Attention" statuses)
  - Added settings tab to the Reading Statistics page
  - Implemented server endpoints for saving and retrieving settings
  - Updated the getReadingStatus function to use configurable durations instead of hardcoded values
  - Added visual feedback when settings are saved or reset

- Implemented session management functionality
  - Created a new StudentSessions component to display all sessions for a student
  - Added ability to edit session details (date, assessment, notes)
  - Added ability to delete sessions
  - Made student cards clickable to view all sessions
  - Added "View All Sessions" option to the student card menu

- Added new functions to AppContext
  - Implemented editReadingSession function to update session details
  - Implemented deleteReadingSession function to remove sessions
  - Implemented updateReadingStatusSettings function to save settings
  - Ensured proper lastReadDate recalculation when sessions are edited or deleted

- Fixed issues with reading sessions display and date tracking
  - Fixed UI to show a message when a student has more than 3 reading sessions
  - Modified the SessionForm component to sort reading sessions by date (newest first)
  - Fixed the lastReadDate calculation to always use the most recent session date
  - Ensured proper date comparison when adding sessions with older dates
  - Fixed missing IconButton import in QuickEntry component

- Implemented sorting functionality for the Students page
  - Added ability to sort by total sessions, name, or last read date
  - Added a dropdown menu with sorting options in the Students page header
  - Implemented sorting functions for each sort type
  - Default sort is still by reading priority
  - Added ascending/descending toggle when selecting the same sort option multiple times
  - Added visual indicators (arrows) to show the current sort direction
  - Fixed issue with toggling sort direction to ensure the student list updates correctly
  - Added support for reversing the reading priority order when toggling direction

## Next Steps
1. **Testing the Settings Functionality**:
   - Test changing reading status durations
   - Verify the visual indicators update correctly with new settings
   - Ensure settings are saved and loaded properly
   - Test the UI for responsiveness and usability

2. **Testing the Session Management Functionality**:
   - Test editing sessions with various data
   - Verify session deletion works correctly
   - Ensure lastReadDate is properly recalculated after edits/deletions
   - Test the UI for responsiveness and usability

3. **Potential Enhancements**:
   - Add bulk session management (delete multiple sessions)
   - Implement session filtering by date range or assessment level
   - Add confirmation for session edits to prevent accidental changes
   - Add more application settings (e.g., default sort order, theme preferences)

4. **Next Feature Implementation**:
   - Implement advanced filtering functionality
   - Enhance reporting capabilities
   - Consider user authentication features
