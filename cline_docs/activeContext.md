# Active Context: Kids Reading Manager

## What I'm Working On Now
I'm implementing a sorting functionality for the Students page that will allow users to sort the student list by:
1. Total sessions (number of reading sessions)
2. Name (alphabetical order)
3. Last read date (most recent first or oldest first)

This feature will enhance the usability of the application by giving users more control over how they view and organize student data.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented sorting functionality for the Students page
  - Added ability to sort by total sessions, name, or last read date
  - Added a dropdown menu with sorting options in the Students page header
  - Implemented sorting functions for each sort type
  - Default sort is still by reading priority
  - Added ascending/descending toggle when selecting the same sort option multiple times
  - Added visual indicators (arrows) to show the current sort direction
  - Fixed issue with toggling sort direction to ensure the student list updates correctly
  - Added support for reversing the reading priority order when toggling direction

## Next Steps
1. **Testing the Sorting Functionality**:
   - Test sorting with various data scenarios
   - Verify sorting works correctly with empty values (e.g., students with no reading sessions)
   - Ensure UI updates correctly when sorting method changes
   - Test the ascending/descending toggle functionality

2. **Potential Enhancements**:
   - Consider adding filtering options to complement sorting
   - Add ability to save preferred sort settings

3. **Next Feature Implementation**:
   - Implement advanced filtering functionality
   - Enhance reporting capabilities
   - Consider user authentication features

## Implementation Plan Completed
✅ Modified the StudentList component to add sorting controls
✅ Implemented sorting functions for each sort type (name, total sessions, last read)
✅ Updated the UI to reflect the current sorting method
✅ Ensured the default sorting (reading priority) is preserved as an option
