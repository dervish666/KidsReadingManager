# Active Context: Kids Reading Manager

## What I'm Working On Now
I've just completed a major dependency update and optimization of the application. This involved:
1. Updating all major dependencies to their latest versions
2. Optimizing the state management in AppContext
3. Fixing layout issues caused by the Material UI v7 update

These changes ensure the application is using the latest libraries and is optimized for performance.

## Recent Changes
- Updated major dependencies to their latest versions
  - Updated Material UI from v5 to v7
  - Updated React from v18 to v19
  - Updated body-parser from v1 to v2
  - Updated uuid from v9 to v11
  - Fixed layout issues caused by the Material UI Grid API changes

- Optimized state management in AppContext
  - Added memoization using React.useMemo for derived data
  - Added memoization using React.useCallback for functions
  - Memoized the context value to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Replaced function calls with memoized arrays for better performance

- Fixed layout issues with Material UI v7
  - Updated all Grid components to use the new API
  - Changed `<Grid item xs={12}>` to `<Grid size={12}>`
  - Changed responsive grid items to use the new format: `<Grid size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 4 }}>`
  - Fixed slider components in Settings and other pages

- Implemented application settings functionality
  - Created a new Settings component to manage application settings
  - Added ability to configure reading status durations (days for "Recently Read" and "Needs Attention" statuses)
  - Added settings tab to the Reading Statistics page
  - Implemented server endpoints for saving and retrieving settings
  - Updated the getReadingStatus function to use configurable durations instead of hardcoded values
  - Added visual feedback when settings are saved or reset

- Implemented session management functionality
  - Created a new StudentSessions component to display all sessions for a student
  - Added ability to edit session details (date, assessment, notes)
  - Added ability to delete sessions
  - Made student cards clickable to view all sessions
  - Added "View All Sessions" option to the student card menu

- Added new functions to AppContext
  - Implemented editReadingSession function to update session details
  - Implemented deleteReadingSession function to remove sessions
  - Implemented updateReadingStatusSettings function to save settings
  - Ensured proper lastReadDate recalculation when sessions are edited or deleted

- Fixed issues with reading sessions display and date tracking
  - Fixed UI to show a message when a student has more than 3 reading sessions
  - Modified the SessionForm component to sort reading sessions by date (newest first)
  - Fixed the lastReadDate calculation to always use the most recent session date
  - Ensured proper date comparison when adding sessions with older dates
  - Fixed missing IconButton import in QuickEntry component

- Implemented sorting functionality for the Students page
  - Added ability to sort by total sessions, name, or last read date
  - Added a dropdown menu with sorting options in the Students page header
  - Implemented sorting functions for each sort type
  - Default sort is still by reading priority
  - Added ascending/descending toggle when selecting the same sort option multiple times
  - Added visual indicators (arrows) to show the current sort direction
  - Fixed issue with toggling sort direction to ensure the student list updates correctly
  - Added support for reversing the reading priority order when toggling direction

## Next Steps
1. **Testing the Updated Dependencies**:
   - Test the application thoroughly with the new dependencies
   - Verify that all features work correctly with Material UI v7 and React 19
   - Check for any performance improvements from the optimizations
   - Monitor for any regressions or issues caused by the updates

2. **Further Optimization Opportunities**:
   - Consider splitting the AppContext into smaller, more focused contexts
   - Add React.memo to components that don't need to re-render often
   - Implement virtualization for long lists of students or sessions

3. **Potential Enhancements**:
   - Add bulk session management (delete multiple sessions)
   - Implement session filtering by date range or assessment level
   - Add confirmation for session edits to prevent accidental changes
   - Add more application settings (e.g., default sort order, theme preferences)

4. **Next Feature Implementation**:
   - Implement advanced filtering functionality
   - Enhance reporting capabilities
   - Consider user authentication features
